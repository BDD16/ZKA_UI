TODO: Project: Shark UI
1) Create a controller for interacting with the password complexity model
2) add in One Text entry
3) add in a static progress bar for that is updated dynamically No need for
calculation button
    -in Java this is easy as there is a key down interrupt.
    -Need to find the equivalent key down signal for implementing the dynamic

4)User Story: Password complexity bar should be calculated as a new character is typed

----------MVP (Minium Viable Product is up to this point)-----------------------
0) include documentation in final production deliverable i.e. USER GUIDE
----------Bells and Whistles----------------------------------------------------

5)Change the color of the bar from red as insufficient, orange as sufficient,
yellow as good, and green as secure.
    -Need to come up with a value indicator that has been published to identify
    These colored tiers

6)Change the background color to a gradient gray (white near the bottom)
7)Ability to be resized (in case screen resolutions change)
8) show the calculated score to the right of the bar (in case the bar is saturated)
9) include a drop down of different languages and and adapt N to the equation.
